# Incident Response Runbook
## IRENO Smart Assistant

### Critical Incident Response (P1)

#### Immediate Actions (0-15 minutes)
1. **Acknowledge and Assess**
   ```bash
   # Check system status
   curl -f http://production-url/health
   
   # Check logs
   kubectl logs -f deployment/ireno-backend
   kubectl logs -f deployment/ireno-frontend
   ```

2. **Establish Communication**
   - Post in #incident-response Slack channel
   - Notify technical lead and on-call engineer
   - Create incident ticket

3. **Quick Triage**
   - Is the main application accessible?
   - Are users able to login?
   - Is the AI responding to queries?
   - Are IRENO APIs reachable?

#### Common P1 Scenarios

##### Scenario 1: Complete Application Down
```bash
# Check deployment status
kubectl get pods -l app=ireno-smart-assistant

# Check recent deployments
kubectl rollout history deployment/ireno-backend
kubectl rollout history deployment/ireno-frontend

# Emergency rollback if needed
kubectl rollout undo deployment/ireno-backend
kubectl rollout undo deployment/ireno-frontend
```

##### Scenario 2: OpenAI API Issues
```bash
# Check API key configuration
kubectl get secret openai-secrets

# Test API connectivity
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
     https://api.openai.com/v1/models

# Enable fallback mode
kubectl patch configmap ireno-config -p '{"data":{"fallback_mode":"true"}}'
```

##### Scenario 3: IRENO API Outage
```bash
# Check IRENO API status
curl -f https://irenoakscluster.westus.cloudapp.azure.com/devicemgmt/v1/collector/count

# Enable cached data mode
kubectl patch configmap ireno-config -p '{"data":{"use_cached_data":"true"}}'
```

### High Priority Incident Response (P2)

#### Investigation Steps
1. **Gather Information**
   - Review monitoring dashboards
   - Check error rates and response times
   - Analyze recent changes

2. **Identify Root Cause**
   - Review application logs
   - Check database performance
   - Verify API dependencies

3. **Implement Fix**
   - Apply hotfix if available
   - Deploy configuration changes
   - Monitor for improvement
